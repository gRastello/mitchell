# Notes on Abelian Categories and Mitchell's Embedding Theorem
This is, as the title implies, a set of note about abelian categores with the ultimate goal of stating and proving Mitchell's embedding theorem. The notes should be fit for people that do not know much category theory (refer to the introduction).

The readable file is [build/mitchell.pdf](./build/mitchell.pdf).

The code is a mess since I initially wanted to keep diagrams in their own folder (namely `diagrams`), but gave up halfway through.
